# What is Loss Mitigated in League of Legends

## Overview

In League of Legends, "loss mitigated" refers to a system that reduces the amount of LP (League Points) you lose in ranked games when certain conditions are met.

## Loss Mitigation System

The loss mitigation system is designed to soften the impact of a loss when a player's team has an AFK (Away From Keyboard) player or a disconnected player for an extended period of time.

## LP Loss Reduction

When a player on your team is AFK or disconnected for a significant portion of the game, the loss mitigated system kicks in to reduce the LP loss for the remaining players on that team. The exact amount of LP loss reduction can vary, but it is typically less severe than a regular loss.

## Addressing Unfair Rank Impact

The loss mitigated system aims to address situations where a player's rank is negatively affected by circumstances beyond their control, such as a teammate leaving the game. By reducing the LP loss, it helps to prevent players from being unfairly penalized for situations that are out of their hands.

## Conditions and Limitations

It's important to note that loss mitigation is not guaranteed in every game with an AFK or disconnected player. The system takes into account various factors, including the duration of the AFK or disconnection, to determine whether loss mitigation should be applied. Additionally, the loss mitigated system only affects LP loss and does not impact other aspects of the game, such as MMR (Matchmaking Rating) or overall win rate.
