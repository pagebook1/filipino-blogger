Under this law, all public telecommunications entities (PTEs) are mandated to establish their respective registration platforms to onboard users who present valid identification cards.<p></p><p><br /></p><p>According to data released by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) as of Sunday, April 23, more than 82 million SIM cards have been registered or 49.31% of total active SIMs as of December 2022. The DICT is aiming to register 70% of active SIMs within the 90-day extension period given, with the original deadline for mandatory SIM registration set for Wednesday, April 26, 2023.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;"><br />Current SIM registration statistics</h3><p><br /></p><p>Of the 82 million registered SIMs, more than 37 million are Globe subscribers, more than 39 million are Smart subscribers, and over five million are Dito subscribers. The DICT's goal is to register as many SIM users as possible to ensure that they have access to telecommunication services and prevent unauthorized SIM card usage.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">What happens if you do not register your SIM?</h3><p><br /></p><p>Users who fail to register their SIMs within the provided 180-day registration period, or until April 26, 2023, risk having their SIMs deactivated. Telcos are obliged to deactivate any unregistered SIM cards in accordance with the law. "Most of the services that come with the cellphones that are not registered will be cut off with the telcos," says Cavite Rep. Jesus Crispin Remulla. "So there will be a social media unavailability for those who do not register."</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Senate principal sponsor welcomes extension period</h3><p><br /></p><p>Senator Grace Poe, principal sponsor of the law, welcomed the 90-day extension period given for SIM registration. She urged the telecommunications companies to "go down to the grassroots" and reach out to their subscribers, particularly those in rural and remote areas. "As most telcos have been enjoying vast profits from their services, they have the corresponding obligation and the necessary resources to track down their SIM users and to widen the opportunity for registration," Poe, who is also the chairperson of the Senate Public Services Committee, said.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Implementing regulations of the law</h3><p><br /></p><p>The implementing rules and regulations of the SIM Card Registration Act took effect on December 27, 2022. Data released by DICT showed that more than half of the SIMs — or subscriber identity module — across the country have yet to be registered with their respective PTEs three days before the April 26 deadline. The government will keep a watchful eye on telecommunications companies to ensure that they do not take undue advantage of the public.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Supreme Court rejects TRO request</h3><p><br /></p><p>Last week, the Supreme Court denied the bid to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the implementation of the mandatory SIM registration. A group of petitioners asked the high court to declare as unconstitutional the law mandating the mandatory registration of SIM and to issue a TRO against its implementation. The Court required the respondents to file a comment on the petition within 10 days from the actual receipt of notice.</p><p><br /></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h3><p><br /></p><p>The SIM card registration in the Philippines is an essential step in maintaining national security and preventing unauthorized usage of telecommunication services. Users who fail to register their SIMs risk having their SIMs deactivated, and they will no longer have access to social media and other services. The 90-day extension period given is an opportunity for users to comply with the SIM card registration law. The government and telecommunications companies should work together to ensure that all SIM users are registered before the deadline.</p><p><br /></p><p><i>Keywords:</i></p><p><i>SIM card registration Philippines</i></p><p><i>Mandatory SIM registration deadline</i></p><p><i>Filipino SIM registration</i></p><p><i>Telecommunication services in the Philippines</i></p><p><i>Globe subscriber registration</i></p><p><i>Smart subscriber registration</i></p><p><i>Dito subscriber registration</i></p><p><i>Extension period for SIM registration</i></p><p><i>Deactivation of unregistered SIMs</i></p><p><i>Senate on SIM registration</i></p><p><i>DICT on SIM registration</i></p><p><i>Supreme Court decision on SIM registration</i></p>
