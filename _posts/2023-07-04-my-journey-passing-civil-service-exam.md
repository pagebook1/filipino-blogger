## Preparation and Resourcefulness

To prepare for the exam, I invested in the Brainbox Volume 2 reviewer, a valuable tool that guided me throughout my study sessions. Seeking additional guidance, I turned to TikTok videos and discovered the helpful tutorials by Coach Lyka on YouTube. These unconventional study aids provided me with practical tips and practice exercises, becoming unexpected sources of inspiration and motivation.

## Battling Self-Doubt

Despite my diligent preparations, self-doubt began to creep into my thoughts. I lacked confidence in my abilities and found myself questioning whether I would be successful. However, I refused to let these doubts discourage me, holding onto a glimmer of hope and determination to face the upcoming exam.

## The Exam Day Experience

When the long-awaited exam day arrived, I made my way to the examination center at Dalahican National High School. As I entered the room, a mix of anticipation and nervousness filled the air. Taking my seat, I braced myself for the challenge that lay ahead.

## Confusion and Perseverance

As I delved into the exam, the vocabulary section presented a bewildering array of choices, each seeming equally plausible. I carefully read and analyzed each question, doing my best to select the most fitting answer. Despite moments of confusion, I persevered, determined to give my all.

## Maximizing Opportunities

With the clock ticking, I made sure not to leave any blanks on my answer sheet. Even if I had uncertainties, I took educated guesses, aiming to maximize my chances of getting points. The numerical and analytical sections proved to be demanding, consuming a considerable amount of my time and mental effort. Nevertheless, I remained focused and worked diligently to tackle each question.

After completing the exam, I entered a period of anxious waiting. Days turned into weeks, and the suspense grew. Doubts and worries tried to taunt me, but I held onto the hope that my efforts would be rewarded. The wait was agonizing, but I remained patient, knowing that the results would eventually be unveiled.

Finally, on June 9, 2023, the long-awaited moment arrived. A friend approached me with a smile, delivering the incredible news that I had passed the exam. A rush of relief and happiness washed over me as I realized that my hard work had paid off. My score reflected my dedication, with an average of 80.12%, just above the required passing grade of 80%. It was a moment of pure joy and validation.

Overflowing with gratitude, I took a moment to reflect on my journey and express heartfelt thanks. I felt grateful for the opportunities that led me to this point, grateful for the support from my family and friends who believed in me, and grateful for the resources and study materials that helped me prepare.

With the weight of uncertainty lifted off my shoulders, I allowed myself to bask in the joy of my achievement. I celebrated this milestone not only as a personal victory but also as a testament to the power of perseverance and self-belief.
