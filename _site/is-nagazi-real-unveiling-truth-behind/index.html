But the question arises: does this group have any basis in reality? Similar to its predecessor, Extraction 2 places less emphasis on the plot and prioritizes high-octane action.

The complication lies in the fact that she is married to Davit Radiani, a founding member of the Nagazi. This Georgian paramilitary and crime organization, known for their cult-like devotion, becomes mobilized for revenge when Rake kills Davit during the prison extraction. Zarab, Davit’s brother, leads the Nagazi in pursuit of Rake and his team, resulting in widespread chaos spanning Georgia and Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ads1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Nagazi’s Rise: From Petty Crime to Controlling a Billion-Dollar Drug Empire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Extraction 2 delves into the history and operations of the Nagazi, it is important to note that the Nagazi itself is not a real gang. Idris Elba’s character, Alcott, provides Rake with a comprehensive background of the Nagazi, detailing how Davit and Zarab evolved from petty criminals to powerful leaders of a billion-dollar drug empire, exerting significant influence over the country. The Nagazi’s rise to power allegedly involved the elimination of a substantial portion of the Armenian mafia. Though inspired by real-life Georgian mafia elements, the Nagazi is a fictional creation in the context of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ads2)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Nagazi’s Deceptive Devotion: Understanding the Cult-like Loyalty of its Members&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice of the name “Nagazi” in Extraction 2 is explained within the film. The backstory of Zurab and Davit reveals that they were forced into a life of crime as children due to a civil war and the need to survive. Religion played a significant role in their upbringing, with Alcott explaining that they believed themselves to be chosen soldiers of God. The term “Nagazi” translates to “Shepherd,” alluding to Davit and Zurab’s perception of themselves as leaders guiding their loyal followers, who obey their every command without question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A Battle of Convictions: Religion, Revenge, and the Final Showdown with Zurab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraction 2 provides limited insight into the inner workings of the Nagazi, as they primarily serve as disposable foot soldiers for Zurab’s confrontations with Rake and his team. Despite his religious convictions, Zurab orchestrates the final showdown with Rake in a church, heightening the tension. While Zurab poses as a formidable antagonist in Extraction 2, the outcome of the ultimate battle is largely predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ads1)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that while the Nagazi is a central element in Extraction 2, the group itself is a fictional creation within the context of the movie.

The backstory of Zurab and Davit reveals that they were forced into a life of crime as children due to a civil war and the need to survive. Religion played a significant role in their upbringing, with Alcott explaining that they believed themselves to be chosen soldiers of God. The term "Nagazi" translates to "Shepherd," alluding to Davit and Zurab's perception of themselves as leaders guiding their loyal followers, who obey their every command without question.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhY5G5VD31W0UXfsXi0f_60Nbb6p9yx5o0Z9XKsVr3V391Ve951h_P2C_-Ylo-320Bo99w9R4PCJkWlHA_f9B2gat1clzYbGWzzVfRbf2Kcjns7N1maEMV5ZkVDj1-Ucmbn0k2D6XYibI4HdgeurJThE-9c_uAGvzP7hLVkMex36VKpyGAK6kcwbr0j" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" data-original-height="392" data-original-width="696" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhY5G5VD31W0UXfsXi0f_60Nbb6p9yx5o0Z9XKsVr3V391Ve951h_P2C_-Ylo-320Bo99w9R4PCJkWlHA_f9B2gat1clzYbGWzzVfRbf2Kcjns7N1maEMV5ZkVDj1-Ucmbn0k2D6XYibI4HdgeurJThE-9c_uAGvzP7hLVkMex36VKpyGAK6kcwbr0j" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><p></p><h3 style="text-align: left;">A Battle of Convictions: Religion, Revenge, and the Final Showdown with Zurab</h3><p>Extraction 2 provides limited insight into the inner workings of the Nagazi, as they primarily serve as disposable foot soldiers for Zurab's confrontations with Rake and his team.
