<meta name="description" content="Tragic Incident Unfolds at Plaza Hollywood: Two Young Women Fatally Attacked by 39-Year-Old Assailant In a shocking turn of events, Plaza Hollywood became the site of a brutal and daring attack on Friday, resulting in the tragic deaths of two women aged 22 and 26. The assailant, a 39-year-old man armed with a chilling 12-inch-long knife, carried out this heinous act at approximately 5 pm. The unsuspecting victims were engaged in a routine shopping excursion on the third floor of Diamond Hill mall when the unimaginable unfolded. Security camera footage captured the chilling moments as the assailant struck from behind, viciously stabbing one of the women outside a cosmetic shop. The force of the attack left the victim crumpled to the ground, but the perpetrator showed no mercy, relentlessly continuing his assault on the defenseless woman. In a heroic act of bravery, the victim&#39;s nearby friend intervened, pushing the assailant away and attempting to protect her wounded companion. However, the assailant quickly regained his footing and charged towards the pair once more. As the injured woman was being pulled to safety, leaving behind a harrowing trail of blood, the assailant brandished his deadly weapon, intimidating the victim&#39;s friend. Subsequently, he forcefully pinned the woman to the ground, ruthlessly targeting her vulnerable body with the knife. Eventually ceasing his assault, the assailant abruptly shifted his attention and began pursuing the woman&#39;s friend. Tragically, the 26-year-old victim succumbed to her injuries at the scene, while the 22-year-old victim was swiftly rushed to United Christian Hospital. Despite the best efforts of medical professionals, she was later pronounced dead. The profound loss and devastation caused by this senseless act of violence is immeasurable. Prompt police response was critical in this dire situation. Officers donning protective vests and carrying shields promptly arrived at the mall, where they bravely immobilized the assailant, swiftly apprehending him and ensuring no further harm could be inflicted. Consequently, the mall was cordoned off, and authorities classified the case as murder, launching a thorough investigation into the motive behind this appalling incident. As the investigation unfolds, the community remains in shock and mourning, grappling to comprehend the senseless loss of two vibrant lives. &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot; - Edmund Burke Watch here" />
