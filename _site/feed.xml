  Card Registration Act, Republic Act No. 11934, making it the first law he
  signed as the Philippines' chief executive. The Sim Card Registration Act
  Philippines aims to promote accountability in the use of SIM cards and aid law
  enforcers in tracking perpetrators of phone-related crimes.

<h3 style="text-align: left">
  What is the Sim Card Registration Act Philippines?
</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Sim Card Registration Act Philippines or Republic Act No. 11934 is a new
  law mandating the registration of all SIM cards sold and used in the
  Philippines. Telco companies and direct sellers must ask for a valid
  identification document from customers before selling a SIM card.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">
  Penalties for False Information and Fictitious Identities
</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Sim Card Registration Act Philippines imposes penalties for those who
  register a SIM card with false or fictitious information, use fictitious
  identities, or commit fraudulent activities. Telcos must provide SIM card
  owners' full names and addresses in case of a subpoena or court order.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Registration Period</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  To comply with the Sim Card Registration Act Philippines, people with SIM
  cards already need to register within a defined timeframe. The government has
  yet to announce the registration period.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">
  Subscriber SIM Cards Must Be Kept on File by Telecommunications Companies
</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Telecommunications companies must keep a record of subscriber SIM cards.
  Additionally, companies must submit a list of authorized dealers and agents to
  the National Telecommunications Commission quarterly.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Helping Law Enforcement Agencies</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Sim Card Registration Act Philippines enables law enforcement agencies to
  ask telcos to look up SIM card owners when investigating crimes committed
  through phones. The law serves as a boost to government initiatives against
  scams committed through text and online messages, which have increased in
  recent years.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">The Signing Ceremony</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The signing ceremony of the Sim Card Registration Act Philippines was held at
  the Malacañang Ceremonial Hall in the presence of several lawmakers, including
  House Speaker and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez. According to the Office of the
  Press Secretary officer-in-charge Cheloy Garafil, the legislation aims to
  provide accountability in the use of SIM cards while assisting law enforcers
  in tracking phone-related crimes.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Conclusion</h3>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Sim Card Registration Act Philippines promotes accountability in the use
  of SIM cards, and the law aligns with the government's efforts to enhance
  privacy and safety protection. The law aims to help law enforcement agencies
  track perpetrators of phone-related crimes, which are becoming more
  commonplace. People with SIM cards must comply with the Sim Card Registration
  Act rules to avoid deactivation and potential penalties for inaccurate

Remember to comply with the registration process to avoid service cutoff and financial penalties.Keywords:SIM card registrationPhilippines SIM card registrationExtended deadline for SIM card registrationMandatory SIM card registration in the PhilippinesNational Telecommunications CommissionService providerPenalties for non-complianceRemote area registrationPrivacy during registrationCriminal activities and mobile phones.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SIM card registration in the Philippines: 49.31% of total active SIMs registered as of April 2023</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sim-card-registration-philippines-49percent-registered-april-2023/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SIM card registration in the Philippines: 49.31% of total active SIMs registered as of April 2023" /><published>2023-06-20T21:28:00+08:00</published><updated>2023-06-20T21:28:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sim-card-registration-philippines-49percent-registered-april-2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sim-card-registration-philippines-49percent-registered-april-2023/"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiYP7Om2B8C0M_55VDjWSeqRLUAI0zszIZLf14BMP9wSQ1xayoeiKA89WU_ac81gEJQRJu-rpCVUEILG54n7MYoqwQW_v8LKCgPdeuUr85WTIaYHSsW8KpKruBOKXvQFYArlM7ooKcUW5Tpy4hDvi0mOXkLgz9vr96MAG3E9tj6Ai4ZKLAnf3UzJEXzfjo" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="sim-card-registration-deadline" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="360" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiYP7Om2B8C0M_55VDjWSeqRLUAI0zszIZLf14BMP9wSQ1xayoeiKA89WU_ac81gEJQRJu-rpCVUEILG54n7MYoqwQW_v8LKCgPdeuUr85WTIaYHSsW8KpKruBOKXvQFYArlM7ooKcUW5Tpy4hDvi0mOXkLgz9vr96MAG3E9tj6Ai4ZKLAnf3UzJEXzfjo=w640-h360" title="Deadline of Sim card Registration" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br />The SIM card registration in the Philippines has been ongoing since the government passed the SIM Card Registration Act.
